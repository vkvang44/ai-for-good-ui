# AI for Good UI 💻🌿
## Team: ATLAS JV

Welcome to AI for Good UI – where technology meets heart! This project is a sleek, modern user interface built to showcase how artificial intelligence can be harnessed for positive change. Whether you’re a developer, a designer, or simply a tech enthusiast with a passion for making the world a better place, you’re in the right spot.

 ✏️ Our team helped develop a writing assessment tool with the use of AI Agents to help 826 Valencia, a NGO dedicated to providing writing and publishing programs to underserved communities. ✏️

## The Challenge 💡:
With over 400 students working on a variety of writing projects at any given time, the organization relies on a small team of less than 10 staff members and folks who volunteer their time to mentor, grade, and provide feedback. The demands of training, reviewing, and scoring these writing projects can become overwhelming, leading to bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the organization's operations 🌀

What’s This All About?
AI for Good UI is a playground for ideas, a starting point for building applications that drive social impact. With a foundation in Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, our interface is designed to be:
	•	Modern & Responsive: A smooth, clean experience on any device.
	•	User-Friendly: Intuitive design so you can focus on what really matters.
	•	Impact-Driven: A demonstration of how AI can be leveraged for the greater good.

## Our solution 🌱:
Designing and developing an AI-powered tool that can assist 826 Valencia's staff and interns in streamlining their grading and feedback process. The tool addresses the following painpoints:
- Standardize and automate aspects of grading and feedback, reducing the time and effort required by staff 🕐
- Provide high-quality, personalized feedback to students, including strategies for improvement and next steps 📓
- Be low-cost, easy to use, and require minimal training for volunteers and staff 💰✅
- Ensure that student work remains private and secure, without being exposed to the public domain 📵
- Enhance the efficiency of 826 Valencia's operations while maintaining the organization's commitment to fostering creativity and mentorship 📚📊🌟
